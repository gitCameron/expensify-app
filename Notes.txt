React-Router: Server vs Client 

* Server-side routing: when user requests a page or clicks a link in the navigation bar of the web page, the browser will go and request the page from the server.
The server will then return the HTML to be rendered in the browser.

* Client-side routing: user makes a request for the web application, the client then watches for URL changes and runs javascript code.  When user does something, it
finds matching component and renders it with javascript function call.
